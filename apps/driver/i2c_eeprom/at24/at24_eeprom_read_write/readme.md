# I2C EEPROM AT24 driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT24 driver to perform read and write operations on AT24 series of EEPROM.

## Description

- This example uses the AT24 driver to communicate with I2C based On-Board AT24MAC402 series EEPROMs to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment.
